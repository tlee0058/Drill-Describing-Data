Given the option of 3 doors and only one prize is hidden in one of the doors, the probability of picking the correct door is 1 over 3 (1/3), which means there is a greater probability in picking the wrong door.

Let's assume the contestant picked the right door first time around, the host would reveal one of the wrong doors, and it would not make sense for the contestant to switch.
Let's assume again the contestant picked the wrong door on the first time, host would reveal the other wrong door, so switching would be the correct choice.
Finally, let's assume the contestant also picked the other wrong door on the first try, host would reveal the other wrong door, so switching would also make sense for the contestant.

Given the 3 pontential senarios above, it indicates a greater probability to win when switching door (2 over 3 - 2/3). And since there is a greater chance of the contestant picking the wrong door in the first guess, it would make more sense if the contestants always switch door.
