In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the theoretical or actual data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

1) Since the date is very close to a major holiday, a lot of household may not rent out their places. And a big parade might be held in a certain

.

2) The survey is bias in that a tragedy took place the day before in NY City, causing the obvious spike in mental health services use. One can rephrase the question such as 'How do 
patterns of use vary before September 10, 2001?'

3) Majority of population is student therefore we should reframe it to 'What are the most common reasons Armenians
students visit local pubs?
